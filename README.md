**gradheat-analyzer** is an open-source CLI tool that analyzes Gradle builds to detect task-level bottlenecks and suggest actionable performance improvements.
It helps developers understand and optimize build performance through transparent, extensible, and inspectable diagnostics.

This project emphasizes systems-level performance and practical developer workflows.
Whether you're maintaining a Kotlin/JVM-based project or tuning a large CI pipeline, `gradheat-analyzer` provides meaningful insights—without relying on external services.

---

## Project Vision

* Promote open tooling in build performance diagnostics
* Offer a lightweight alternative to proprietary build profilers
* Lower the barrier to understanding and optimizing build systems

---

##  Key Features (Planned)

* Parse and summarize task durations from Gradle build logs
* Detect known inefficiencies like non-incremental builds using static rules
* Provide practical suggestions for build optimization
* Optional HTML reports for visualization
* Minimal-dependency, CLI-first design

---

## Who It's For

* Developers using **Gradle** for Kotlin/JVM projects
* Build engineers looking for **lightweight insights**
* OSS maintainers managing large or slow build pipelines

---

## Project Status

> Currently in the early development phase — evolving rapidly.
> Feedback, suggestions, and contributions are very welcome.
